 * `director` and `writer` are arrays of names. Entries written while they were
 * joined into one string are still readable, and the component key they live
 * under is derived from the configuration rather than from the field's shape,
 * so nothing expires them early. Reads coerce instead, which costs one check
 * per meta and lets those entries age out on their own.
 *
 * A name that itself contained a comma was already lost to the join, so the
 * split cannot recover it. Splitting still reads better than handing a client
 * the wrong type for the field.
